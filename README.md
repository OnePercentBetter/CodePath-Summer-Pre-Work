**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Salah Alhudais**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Did not use any outside resources]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I've only ever used Python and C++ so using HTML,CSS and Javascript was very unfamiliar and unsettling too! To resolve this, I took some time to
digest the syntax and it all makes sense afterwards. Things like "onclick" and getElementById are all super intuitive things
that just need basic familiarity than to really think through.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have a lot! How do you make websites more dynamic? How do you add movement like slideshows to your website? What do you use to manage the backend? How do you store user responses?
How does the client know how to resize it's window based on the device it's on? How do you add other windows or other fields to the current one? I've heard of tech stacks, what are they? How are edge cases handled
in web development? To what degree should a developer be wary of UI and ease of use? How should I organize my code in Javascript, is there a paradigm? Is there anything I can do 
to optimize for loading times? how do I opt for automatically shifting to pure HTML when a user's bandwidth/internet is weak/has low signal? What are the protocols for debugging code in full-stack dev? 
TLDR: I HAVE A LOT!]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I wanted to find out how I can connect the buttons on the screen to keyboard buttons for easier/better accessibility. I wanted to also maybe shorten the duration of the sound and increase the amount of patterns based on 
a music-related website with an API that provides the same chords and tones. Even with 4 buttons for 4 different tones, I don't think it's expressive and adventerous enough so I might've opted for the optional feature of adding
more buttons/tones but I wanted to finish my application in one night since I'll be super busy for the rest of the month! Aside from that, maybe add background effects to the tone pressed such as the music theory scales/modes with a pitch
to better sync the player timing. Or even to gauge the success of the game's completion by the timing of button being pressed after the clue is played. All in all so many things I want to add and change yet little time to do so!]
